# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My initial estimates were often too optimistic, underestimating the complexity of the tasks or overestimating my speed. This frequently led to needing more time than anticipated, especially for debugging and refining code.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As the semester progressed, I became more experienced and was able to gauge the complexity of tasks more accurately. By reflecting on past practicals, I learned to allocate extra time for unexpected challenges and testing, which improved the realism of my estimates.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of considering all aspects of a task, including planning, coding, testing, and debugging. I also learned that it's beneficial to review and adjust estimates as work progresses and new information becomes available.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Receiving feedback from others exposed me to different coding styles and approaches. It highlighted areas for improvement in my own code, such as optimizing logic and enhancing readability. Constructive criticism was invaluable for learning best practices and discovering more efficient methods of problem-solving.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code taught me to critically analyze code quality and functionality. It helped refine my ability to spot errors and offered insight into alternative coding techniques. This practice also improved my ability to articulate constructive feedback, which is essential for collaborative environments.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1
https://github.com/MoeKhant7711/cp1404Practicals/pull/5/commits/c336fef42cc27065fc68247d85b572b3b90c1ae2#r1864883306
### Explanation

I pay attention to error handling, and whenever a classmate misses a mistake handling, I point it out.

### Good Code Review 2
https://github.com/raygong1207/cp1404practicals/pull/2/commits/aadf8e6a8f151752bbaa3fe555aef0016939f7d9#r1864897257
### Explanation

The suggestions are very clear, pointing out the specific role of the fanciness attribute in the SilverServiceTaxi class and its impact on fare calculation, helping students better understand the intent and application of the attribute and ensure its correct implementation and use.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would incorporate more real-world examples and applications to demonstrate how theoretical concepts are applied in practice. Additionally, I would encourage more peer programming sessions, as they are highly beneficial for learning from classmates and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I excelled in applying learned concepts to solve the practical tasks creatively. My commitment to thoroughly testing and debugging my code resulted in robust solutions. I also made an effort to assist peers, which reinforced my understanding and helped develop strong teamwork skills.
